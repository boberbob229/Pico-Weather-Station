Hello, 

My name is bober, i like to work on stuff and this is one of my projects. It is a weatherstation for the pico without a weather station but instead a tempature station we have a weatherapi. 

The code is very easy to read and modify, i hope you have fun with it! 



Requirements: A brain, some kind of text editor, python3 and a Pico W(running CircutPy), Putty if you need to debug.

I will make a Pico 2W verison soon the price is just crazy :)





Farewell stranger! :)
